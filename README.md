Q1:Why can't we rely on CPU execution time to measure algorithm effeciency?
Because every computer has different RAMs and memories.A super fast computer would compute faster then an old personal computer.

Q2:How many operations does this code execute?
int sum = 0;
sum = sum + 5;
Time complexity: O(1) Number of Operations: 1 + 1 = 2

Q3:Give the final time complexity of the code.
a.Time Complexity: O(n) Number of operations: 1+1+n+1+n+2n = 3 + 4n
b.Time Complexity: O(n^2)  Number of Operations: n^2
c.Time Complexity: O(logn) Number of Operations: 10
